          <p> The word engine derives from Old< French engin, from the Latin ingenium–the root of the word ingenious.Pre-industrial weapons of war, such as catapults,trebuchets and battering rams, were called siege engines, and knowledge of how to construct them was often treated as a military secret. The word gin, as in cotton gin, is short for engine.  Motor and engine later came to be used largely interchangeably in casual discourse. However, technically, the two words have different meanings. An engine is a device that burns or otherwise consumes fuel, changing its chemical composition, whereas a motor is a device driven by electricity, air, or hydraulic pressure, which does not change the chemical composition of its energy source.[4][5] However, rocketry uses the term rocket motor, even though they consume fuel. </p>
